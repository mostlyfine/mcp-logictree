## Usage Examples

### AI-Guided Workflow (Recommended)
```json
// 1. Start with status check (ALWAYS begin with this)
{"operation": "get_status"}
// Response includes: current state, AI guidance, suggested next operations

// 2. If tree is empty, AI will guide you to create root problem
{"operation": "add_node", "content": "Low website conversion rate", "nodeType": "problem"}

// 3. Check progress and get next steps
{"operation": "quick_analysis"}
// Response: focused insights, key findings, next actions, AI guidance

// 4. Get specific next step recommendations
{"operation": "next_steps"}
// Response: exact parameters to use, workflow guidance, reasoning
```

### Basic Problem Analysis
```json
// 1. Create root problem
{"operation": "add_node", "content": "Low website conversion rate", "nodeType": "problem"}

// 2. Add potential causes with metadata
{"operation": "add_node", "content": "Slow page load times", "nodeType": "cause", "parentId": "node_1", "metadata": {"confidence": 0.8, "evidence": ["Google Analytics shows 5s average load time", "User feedback mentions slow performance"]}}
{"operation": "add_node", "content": "Confusing navigation", "nodeType": "cause", "parentId": "node_1", "metadata": {"confidence": 0.6, "evidence": ["Heatmap data shows scattered clicks"]}}
{"operation": "add_node", "content": "Weak call-to-action", "nodeType": "cause", "parentId": "node_1", "metadata": {"confidence": 0.7}}

// 3. Add solutions with priority and feasibility
{"operation": "add_node", "content": "Optimize images and compress CSS/JS files by 30%", "nodeType": "solution", "parentId": "node_2", "metadata": {"priority": 5, "feasibility": 4, "assumptions": ["Development team has 2 weeks availability"]}}
{"operation": "add_node", "content": "Redesign main navigation menu with user testing", "nodeType": "solution", "parentId": "node_3", "metadata": {"priority": 3, "feasibility": 2}}
